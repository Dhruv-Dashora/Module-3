# calculator

Continuing with our Flutter project in module 1 where we made a calculator app which performs basic arithemetic operations,in module 2the app now initiates a login process before accessing the calculator screen . The authentication is done using Firebase authentication and uses Email and password for authentication.
Further, in module 3 we added a currency converter screen where using the http package and ExchangeRate-Api we can now exchange rates of different currencies.
Use Test user to login- email:test123 at gmail.com, password:flutter.
Further issues which will be resolved:
1.Previous calculations are not being stored as there is some issue with firestore.
2.Realtime user auth is not availalable yet, because of issue in rules in firesttore.
